            <h3>Web Servers</h3>
            <!-- Explain the concept of a designated <strong>home page<strong> and how its name relates to different servers and languages. -->
            <p>A designated home page is typically the root directory for the website you are visiting.
                This page is typically the user's first introduction to the website, and it is very important
                that it holds useful information and <strong>hyperlinks</strong>. The <strong>web server</strong>
                will typically serve the <strong>index.html</strong> file when the user visits the root URL.
                The designated homepage is typically composed of an <strong>HTML and CSS file</strong>. The designated
                URL contains useful information, such as different file names as well as programming language
                information. For example, static pages can be represented by the physical location of a file on a web
                server. The ending of a URL can also denote what language the page is written in. In Microsoft's .NET
                platform, default.html is the standard home page, denoting the HTML language. In other instances,
                .js or .php can be used as the language and this information will be given in the URL.
            </p>

            <!-- Explain what can be seen in the browser's Web Dev/Inspector Network tab output screen (use the concepts provided
            in the Exploration). What is different about the file's details when viewed from the web server versus the local
            computer? -->
            <p>In the browser's Inspector Network tab, you can see the requested URL, request method, status code,
                remote address, and referrer policy. One of the most helpful tools is the <strong>status code</strong>.
                This allows you to see if the file was served correctly, or if not, allows you to see what kind of error
                occurred. Another helpful tool is the headers tab. This allows you to see all the different headers sent
                and received when the web page was served. When looking at the Network Tab, you can see the status of
                the page. When looking at the status of the page run locally, there is no connection to the server.
                We can see a status of 200, which tells us that index.html is being accessed, but immediately after, we
                see failure for main.css and main.js. When investigating the Network tab on the web page hosted on the
                OSU server, we see a status of 200 for the index.html, we then get status 404 for the main.css and
                main.js. Status 404 tells us that the page we are trying to access in unavailable, but our website is
                attempting to access the page.
            </p>

            <!-- Explain why the favicon.ico file has a status 200, but the main.css and main.js files have a status 404. -->
            <p>The favicon.ico file is an icon file for the webpage. It can be seen at the top of the browser, inside
                the tab that holds the site. When viewed from the Network tab of the developer tools in the browser, it
                displays an HTTP 200 status code, signifying that its contents were found and served with no errors. The
                main.js and main.css files, on the other hand, display a 404 error code, signifying that the files could
                not be found and served by the web server.
            </p>

            <!-- Explain the parts of your web server's URL. What are the scheme, the subdomains, the host domain, and the
            resources? -->
            <p>There are many parts of my web server's URL. The <strong>scheme</strong> is https://.
                The <strong>subdomains</strong> are web and engr.
                The <strong>domain</strong> is oregonstate.edu, and the resources are ~wimpeys/webdev/M1/a1-wimpeys/.

            <h3>Frontend Design</h3>
            <!-- The concept of frontend design, in a <p> paragraph. -->
            <p> <strong>Frontend design</strong> involves creating a good experience for the user when they interact
                with a product or system. An effective design includes pleasing visuals such as a color scheme,
                appropriate fonts, and pictures. It also ensures the website is relatively easy to navigate. The quality
                of a website's design is measured by its <strong>usability</strong> and <strong>inclusivity</strong>.
                Usability is determined by evaluating a product or system using the Five "E"s.

            <!-- The purpose of each of the page layout tags, in a <p> paragraph.  Focus on the 6 we use in this assignment. -->
            <p> Page layout tags serve the purpose of breaking up content and adding structure to a page of a website. A
                page usually includes a header, nav, main, articles, asides, and a footer. The <strong>header</strong>
                is usually at the top of the page and displays the website's name, publisher, and marketing slogan.
                The <strong>nav</strong> element helps users move from page-to-page quickly and easily. They often
                appear as clickable button shortcuts to main menu, search, tools, stories, locations, and legal links.
                The <strong>main</strong> element is the main area of a page that organizes the website's content into
                different categories. <strong>Sections</strong> are groups of similarly themed content on a web page.
                Within a section, there may be multiple <strong>articles</strong> that discuss unique topics relating to
                its section's theme. A <strong>footer</strong> tag is typically displayed at the bottom of a web page
                and contains information such as the website owner's copyright statement, contact information, and legal
                information.
            </p>

            <!-- How anchors link to external content, internal content, and from page-to-page, in an <ol> ordered list. -->
            <ol>
                <li>Anchors link to external content by using the href attribute and including the URL of the desired
                    page inside the anchor tags. Linking to external content requires an <strong>absolute path</strong>
                    that includes a complete URL to the outside resource.</li>
                <li>Anchors link internal content by using IDs. The ID attribute is paired with the href attribute,
                    which includes a hashtag plus the ID. This type of link will jump to the specified topic on the
                    page. Linking to internal content can be accomplished using a relative path. A <strong>relative
                        path</strong> includes a URL that points to a location in a file.</li>
                <li>Anchors link from page-to-page in the same way as linking to external content. Page-to-page links
                    are usually displayed to look like buttons.</li>

        <article id="optimizingImages">
            <h3>Optimizing Images</h3>
            <!-- Name and explain the purpose of the 6 major image optimizing specifications. -->
            <p> Optimized images meet 6 important specifications. It helps search engines categorize images if they are
                assigned a <strong>descriptive file name</strong>. To ensure the images load
                quickly on a web page, compress the images down to a <strong>small file size</strong>. Crop images
                to <strong>exact dimensions</strong> to ensure they fit properly on the web page. Make sure the images
                are saved in the <strong>correct file format</strong> and <strong>color mode</strong>. Lastly, always
                <strong>reduce resolution</strong> for optimal load time.
            </p>
            <!-- Name and explain the file formats appropriate for photos and for line art? -->
            <p> JPG and WebP are typically appropriate file formats for photos. JPG supports most colors and holds high
                image quality and resolution even after compression. <strong>JPG</strong> works especially well with
                images that have smooth color transitions. SVG, PNG, or GIF are better suited for line art.
                <strong>SVG</strong> is
                excellent for line art and graphics, beacause it holds very high quality at any size.
                <strong>PNG</strong> is similar to SVG, but
                it offers lossless compression, meaning it loses no quality during compression. <strong>GIF</strong> is
                often used
                for simple graphics or animations that are not hindered by its limited color options. GIF can only
                display 256
                colors in an image, making it less ideal for more complex images.

            <h3>Favicons</h3>
            <!-- How do browsers and devices use favicons? -->
            <p> <strong>Favicons</strong> are favorite icons or logos that appear in the browser tab to identify a
                website quickly.
                Saving a web page to the home screen of a handheld device will display an application identified by the
                favicon icon.

            <h3>Cascading Stylesheets</h3>
            <!--What are the main reasons to incorporate stylesheets in websites and apps?-->
            <p> <strong>Cascading Stylesheets</strong> are used to add more in-depth style to a webpage. CSS redefines
                how a webpage appears to the user and how they interact with the site. The main reasons for adding style
                is to improve usability and readability, and offer website customization while incorporating brand or
                company requirements.

            </p>
            <!--What are the 5 ways to incorporate styles? And why?-->
            <p>
                There are 5 main ways to incorporate style. CSS files are <strong>linked</strong> in the global head of
                a website or <strong>imported</strong> into a global stylesheet. Style can also be
                <strong>embedded</strong> in a style tag, written <strong>inline</strong> using an attribute and value,
                or by using the Document Object Model in <strong>JavaScript</strong>.
