                    My career aspirations are rooted in my passion for computer
                    science and my desire to make a meaningful impact in the field of Front-End Development.
                    One of my primary career goals is to secure a position in front-end development, where I can leverage
                    my creativity to craft engaging and user-friendly interfaces. I thrive in environments that encourage
                    innovation and collaboration, and I'm eager to contribute my skills to projects that push the
                    boundaries of web design.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Beyond technical proficiency, I'm deeply committed to promoting diversity and inclusion within the
                    software industry. As a woman in tech, I recognize the importance of representation and strive to empower
                    other women to pursue careers in STEM fields. I'm dedicated to fostering a supportive and inclusive environment
                    where all voices are heard and valued.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally, I believe in using technology responsibly and ethically, prioritizing user privacy and security in all my projects.
                    Integrity and accountability guide my approach to coding, and I'm committed to upholding the highest standards of
                    ethical conduct in my work.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My career goals encompass not only technical excellence in front-end development but also a commitment to diversity,
                    inclusion, and ethical coding practices. I'm excited to embark on a career where I can combine my passion for technology with my
                    values-driven approach to make a positive impact in the software industry.

                    <dt>HTML</dt>
                    <dd>HTML or HyperText Markup Language is the standard language used to create and design the structure of web pages.
                        HTML is fundamental to web development, serving as the foundation for web page structure and content. Its combination with CSS
                        and JavaScript creates a comprehensive development environment, enabling the creation of visually appealing, interactive, and user-friendly websites.</dd>
                    <dt>CSS</dt>
                    <dd>CSS or Cascading Style Sheets is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation and layout of a document written in HTML. It controls
                        the visual appearance of web pages. I used CSS to add color, fonts, and layout preferences to my website. </dd>
                    <dt>Node</dt>
                    <dd>Node is a runtime environment that allows developers to use JavaScript code for both client-side and server-side programming. It's ideal for
                        creating real-time applications and serving static files such as HTML and CSS, which is how I host my website.  </dd>
                    <dt>Express</dt>
                    <dd>Express is a web application framework that provides an excellent set of features to develop web and mobile applications. Some of its
                        key functions in my website include serving static files, handling HTTP requests and responses, and handling errors.</dd>
                    <dt>Asynchronous programming</dt>
                    <dd>Asynchronous programming allows the execution of operations without blocking the main program flow. Two concepts used in my website
                        are Promises and the Async/Await features. Async is used to define a function that returns a Promise and Await is used to pause
                        execution of the function until the Promise is fulfilled.  </dd>
                    <dt>MongoDB</dt>
                    <dd>MongoDB is a database designed to handle large amounts of data. It works well for modern web applications where data
                        requirements can change rapidly. I used MongoDB in my website to store data about my friends from the table on my Friends page. </dd>
                    <dt>Mongoose</dt>
                    <dd>Mongoose is a library for MongoDB and Node. It allows you to define schemas for your data models and simplifies the
                        process of performing CRUD operations. </dd>
                    <dt>React</dt>
                    <dd>React is a JavaScript library for building single page applications. I used React to create my web application beacuse it
                        can update and render efficiently in response to data changes.  </dd>
                    <dt>JavaScript</dt>
                    <dd>JavaScript is a vital programming language in web development. It is used in handling events and supports Asynchronous Programming.</dd>
                    <dt>DOM</dt>
                    <dd>Document Object Model is a programming interface for web documents that represents a document as a tree of objects. It's useful for
                        adding or removing elements. In my website, it's used to create, edit, remove, find, and retrieve friends from my Friends List.
                    </dd>
                    <dt>CRUD</dt>
                    <dd>CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete, which are the four basic operations used to manage data
                        in a database or application. These operations work with MongoDB and are used in my website specifically on my Friends page to add,
                        edit, remove, or retrieve my friends. </dd>
